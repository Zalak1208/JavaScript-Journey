there are only two types of datatypes : 1. primitive 2. non-primitive.
the bifergation is done on the basis of how these dataypes are stored in memory and how they are accessed.
# primitive ( call by value ):
7 types : string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.

JS is dynamically-typed language and not statically-typed, which means interpreter assigns variables a type. no need to specify the datatype during assigning value
eg. const score = 100;

# non-primitive ( call by reference ):
 array, objects, functions.

typeof value of non-primitive datatypes is "OBJECT", and of function is object-function.

Memory:
there are two tyoes of memory : 1. Stack-Memory  2. Heap-Memory
Stack : primitive datatypes
Heap : non-primitive datatypes
